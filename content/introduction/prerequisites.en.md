1. This lab will use the AWS console. So, either the AWS account you already use or [New AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/en/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort) -order=asc) must be created.

2. To try Unity Build, you first need SourceCode. For this lab, I've created an empty Unity project on GitHub for easy follow-up. You need a GitHub account to use your GitHub project to integrate with AWS CodePipeline. If you do not have an account, you can simply create one [here](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home).

3. Build server is configured as a Windows EC2 instance. Therefore, install [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients) to access Windows remotely. Check if your local PC is an environment where you can install [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients).

4. Finally, a simple knowledge of [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/ko/codepipeline/), [Unity](https://unity.com/kr), and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/). Of course, this lab can be done without it. But if you know in advance what role the services and applications used in this lab, you can proceed more easily.
