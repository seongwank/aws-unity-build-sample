This lab will use AWS CodePipeline to configure a Pipeline to build your Android Unity project.
More specifically, a Jenkins server that can build a Unity project on Windows EC2 is built, and an APK file is created in S3 by interworking with AWS CodePipeline.
By applying this exercise, you can create other build versions as well as Android and create Artifacts on S3!
This workshop will take about 2 hours.
If you follow this lab as is, you may be charged a small amount of EC2. However, you can choose an instance of the free tier to proceed with the lab.

This workshop consists of three main steps.
1. Configure a Windows-based Jenkins server using an EC2 instance
2. Create a pipeline by Jenkins server and your SourceCode with AWS Codepipeline
3. After creating the CodePipeline, see how it works
