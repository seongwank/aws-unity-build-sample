## fork GitHub Repository (empty unity project)
First, before getting started with AWS CodePipeline, it needs to create a Repository on GitHub for use in this lab. There is already an Empty unity project ready for this lab. Click [here](https://github.com/seongwank/empty_unity_sample) to open the Github repository browser. And fork this Repository to your Account. You can connect to AWS CodePipeline using your Git Account simply by clicking the **Fork button** on the Github page as shown in the picture below.
