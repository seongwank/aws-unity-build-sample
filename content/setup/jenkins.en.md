## Install JDK
1. If you have enabled download permission, you need to install Java JDK first to install Jenkins. [Download](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/11) of JDK 11 of Windows x64 product.
{{% notice info %}}
In this lab, we will use JDK 11. Currently (February 2021) Jenkins can be installed using [JDK 8, JDK 11 version](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/administration/requirements/java/). Since it is only used for Jenkins installation, there is no need to worry about it. because it doesn't match the JDK version you are actually using. You can also install it with openJDK as well as oracle JDK.
